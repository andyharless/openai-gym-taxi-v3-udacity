## Attempts to solve OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 RL environment
### (Udacity Deep RL course uses v2, but that's deprecated now)

As of this commit (2020-09-08 16:55 UTC), using python 3.8.3, gym 0.17.2, and numpy 1.19.1, "python main.py" produces a score (best average reward of 100) of 9.12.  If you don't cheat and use a good seed, the typical score is more like 9.0
